This project explores the development and implementation of a question-and-answer (Q&A) system designed to handle queries based on a predefined knowledge base and a sophisticated language model. The system, built using Flask, reads from a CSV-based knowledge base and uses the OpenAI API to generate responses dynamically for queries not covered in the static dataset. The hybrid approach aims to provide efficient and contextually relevant answers, demonstrating the potential of combining static and dynamic data sources in a single application.# Answer-Questions-about-any-Knowledge-Base-using-OpenAI
